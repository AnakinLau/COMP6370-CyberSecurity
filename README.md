## UDP Needham-Schroeder Protocol
  Write a program that simulates the Needham-Schroeder protocol using Java, C, or C++.
  
  The program should consist of three actors:
  
    - Central authority
    - User 1
    - User 2
The program should at least complete the forming of a session (initial nonce sent to CA, second nonce from user 2 and modified second nonce in reply from user 1), and they should at least exchange one message.

For each step of the simulation, show both the encrypted and unencrypted messages that are being sent, and indicate who is sending the message, and where it is being sent. 


For example, when Alice(A) is sending the session key to Bob(B):

Alice sending session key to Bob

Encrypted message is: *a;lskdjf;laksjdf;lkja*

Unencrypted message is: *This is Alice, Here is the Session Key* (of course it wonâ€™t really look like this)
